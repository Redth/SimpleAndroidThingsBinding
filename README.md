[Android Things - More Information](https://developer.android.com/things/index.html)

## Building

Use the `build.cake` script to build.  You can execute it via one of the bootstrappers (`build.sh` on mac or `build.ps1` on windows):

Mac:
```
sh build.sh --target libs
```

Windows:
```
powershell .\build.ps1 -Target libs
```

## Getting Started

### Declare a home activity
An application running on an embedded device must declare an activity in its manifest as the main entry point after the device boots.  You can do this by adding the following attributes to your main activity:

```sharp
[Activity(Label = "Sample Thing")]
[IntentFilter (new[] { Intent.ActionMain }, Categories = new[] { Intent.CategoryLauncher })]
[IntentFilter(new[] { Intent.ActionMain }, Categories = new[] { "android.intent.category.IOT_LAUNCHER" })]
public class MainActivity : Activity
{
    // ...
}
```
